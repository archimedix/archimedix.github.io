## About

Archimedix is my name, I live in this wonderful world for over thirty years, my body is on planet earth.
My ideas are in my soul, and my ego controls and governs all the tools.
In addition to the body, other forms of communication between human beings have appeared in the last century, the last of which, the Cyberspace.
People now can exchange ideas and opinions through the multiverse.
The common goal remains the same as the beginning of time: the evolution
